0) Determine key and list.
key <- 'hobby'
list <- [
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Hacking' },
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Juggling' },
]

1) Make sure that key in input is String or any value that can form key for object.

Correct: key <- 'hobby' 
Correct: key <- 0 | any positive integer value
Correct: key <- true | false

Incorrect: key <- -1 | any negative integer value

2) Make sure that key given is in list so that wind can occur properly.
key <- 'hobby'
list <- [
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Hacking' },
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Juggling' },
]
is correct as list[any index] have key as its property.

Correct: result <-  {
    name: 'alice', hobby: ['Hacking','Juggling']
}

3) Make sure that every item in list have all the same properties otherwise merge conflict will occur.
key <- 'hobby'
list <- [
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Hacking' },
    { age: 20 , hobby: 'Juggling' },
]
is incorrect as there will be merge conflict of name and age.

4) Solving Merge conflict can be done by adding all the properties to the result

key <- 'hobby'
list <- [
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Hacking' },
    { age: 20 , hobby: 'Juggling' },
]

Correct: result <- {
    name: 'alice', age: 20,
    hobby: ['Hacking', 'Juggling' ]
}

5) If key is empty string or empty object.

key <- '' | {}
list <- [
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Hacking' },
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Juggling' },
]


Correct: result <- {
    name: 'alice', hobby: 'Juggling'
}

6) No renaming of keys of object.

key <- {hobbies: 'hobby'} || {hobby: 'hobby'}
Simply treat it as no-op (no operation).
