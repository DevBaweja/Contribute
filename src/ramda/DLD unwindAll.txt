1) Determine keys and object so as to get keys which is needed to unwind over the object.
key <- ['hobbies','colors']
object <- {
    name: 'alice',
    hobbies: ['Golf', 'Hacking'],
    colors: ['red', 'green']
}

2) Need to map over the keys so as to obtain object[key]
hobbies <- ['Golf', 'Hacking']
colors <- ['red', 'green']

3) While mapping over keys we need to unwind the object with key of each iteration.
result_1 <- unwind('hobbies', object)
result_2 <- unwind('colors', object)
... 
result_n 

4) Initialize the result with empty list
result <- [];

5) Add all the result_1, result_2, ... result_n into result.
result <- [result_1, result_2, ... result_n];

6) In every iteration of mapping over keys. 

In first iteration
result <- [
    unwind('hobbies', object)
];
In second iteration
result <- [
    unwind('hobbies', object),
    unwind('colors', object)
];
Similarly, at end of it all the keys will be unwinded into its own individual object and added to the result list.

7) Return the result as final output.
return result
