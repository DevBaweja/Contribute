1) Determine key and list so as to get key which is needed to wind the list into single object.
key <- 'hobby'
list <- [
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Hacking' },
    { name: 'alice', hobby: 'Juggling' },
]

2) Initialize an empty object with value of elemnent of the list
object <- {
    name: 'alice'
}

3) Initialize an empty list of list[key]
hobby <- []

4) Iterate over the list and then add each element to the empty list.

5) While iterating over list we need to wind the object with key ie hobby.

In first iteration
hobby <- ['Hacking']
In second iteration
hobby <- ['Hacking', 'Juggling'] 

Similarly, at end of it all the list element will be winded into single object.

6) Add this list to the object under object[key]
object <- {
    name: 'alice', hobby: ['Hacking', 'Juggling']
}

7) Return the object as final output.
return object
