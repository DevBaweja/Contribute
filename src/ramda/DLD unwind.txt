1) Determine key and object so as to get key which is needed to unwind over the object.
key <- 'hobbies'
object <- {
    name: 'alice',
    hobbies: ['Golf', 'Hacking'],
    colors: ['red', 'green']
}

2) Need to reduce over the list named by object's key
object[key] = ['Golf', 'Hacking'];

3) reduce method executes a reducer function on each element of the list, resulting in single output final accumulator value.

4) Initialize accumulator as empty list
accumulator <- [];

5) And by reducing over it is required to add the whole object into the accumulator
accumulator <- [
    object,
    object
];

6) In every iteration of reducer function we need to replace the object[key] ie ['Golf', 'Hacking'] with each element of the list ie 'Golf' and 'Hacking'. 

In first iteration
accumulator <- [
    {
        name: 'alice',
        hobbies: 'Golf',
        colors: ['red', 'green']
    },
];
In second iteration
accumulator <- [
    {
        name: 'alice',
        hobbies: 'Golf',
        colors: ['red', 'green']
    },
    {
        name: 'alice',
        hobbies: 'Hacking',
        colors: ['red', 'green']
    }
];
Similarly, at end of it all the object[key] will be unwinded into its own individual object.

7) Return the accumulator as final output.
return accumulator
